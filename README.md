# Collision and Heat Avoidance Robot
My first proper project in Arduino! I made this in order to learn more about the language, as well as venture deeper into the field of electronics and robotics.  
I'm still working on it and plan to improve and optimise the code, as well as add new features.
# Components Used
I used the following components to make the robot. If you cannot obtain them, use TinkerCAD.  
However, I feel learning hands-on is a better approach to learning!  
Parts Used:
1. **Arduino UNO.**
2. **L298D motor driver shield.** (You can use the IC too, but using the shield saves quite a bit of time.)
3. **HC-SR04** - Ultrasonic distance sensor.
4. **KY-013** - Analog temperature sensor Module. (Uses a thermistor callibrated at 10kΩ. Based on the Steinhart–Hart model.)
